/**
 * A local database context persists data in a local database file without using 
 * a database server. It is usually adequate for storing small amounts of data
 * in the local file system of a device or service. SQLite is a typical example of 
 * such a database. Typically, a local database context is used to persist
 * application or service settings. For example, a local database context can be
 * used in a Node.js environment as well as in a Cordova app (utilizing specific
 * built-in SQLite database adapters).
 * 
 * Besides SQL operations and transactions, a local database context supports
 * local storage of pairs of keys and values. Keys are strings and values are
 * any JSON objects. Values can be retrieved when a key is known or by mapping
 * through all key value pairs.
 * 
 * The local database context features a promise-based interface for
 * asynchronous data flow control. A local database context is a light-weight object
 * that can be used to perform a single operation or multiple operations
 * in sequence. A local database context object can be short-lived but you
 * can also use it for the lifetime of your Coaty container by storing it as an
 * instance member in a controller.
 *
 * To invoke multiple asynchronous operations in sequence, it is best practice to
 * use composing promises and promise chaining. Avoid the common bad practice
 * pattern of nesting promises as if they were callbacks.
 *
 * Note that you can reuse a local database context object even if an operation
 * performed on it fails or throws an error.
 *
 * If you invoke an operation on a local database context that is not supported by
 * the associated database adapter, the returned promise is rejected with an
 * "operation not supported" error.
